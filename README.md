- **MySQL 5.7+** or **PostgreSQL**

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/maryammary99/products.git
   cd products
Install dependencies:
composer install

Environment setup: Copy the example environment configuration:
cp .env.example .env
Then, configure your .env file with database credentials and other necessary configurations (see Configuration).

Run migrations:
php artisan migrate

Configuration
External API Configuration
The system synchronizes with an external API for product data. Ensure the external API URL is defined in the ProductImportService.php file:
private const EXTERNAL_API_URL = 'https://5fc7a13cf3c77600165d89a8.mockapi.io/api/v5/products';

Queue Connection
To improve performance, configure the queue system in your .env file:
QUEUE_CONNECTION=database
If using database as the queue driver, ensure the queue table is migrated:
php artisan queue:table
php artisan migrate

To process the queue, you can start a worker:
php artisan queue:work

Usage
Product Import from CSV
The ProductImportService provides a method to import products from a CSV file. To run this import manually, use the command:
php artisan import:products

Daily Synchronization with External API
The system is set up to synchronize with an external API daily at midnight. This schedule is configured in app/Console/Kernel.php.
To manually trigger synchronization:
php artisan sync:products
